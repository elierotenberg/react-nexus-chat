React Nexus Chat
================

Full demo chat app built with `react-nexus`.

### Running it

- `npm install`

- `npm start`

- Head your browser to `localhost`

- You're done.

If you want to tweak things up, the source code is meant to be very straightfoward - checkout `src/config.jsx` especially for hosts/ports.

If you want to run the server in `development` mode (without minification and much more runtime checks), run:

- `NODE_ENV=developement gulp`

- `NODE_ENV=development node src/server.jsx`

Have fun!
