React Nexus Chat
================

Full demo chat app built with `react-nexus`.

### Running it

- `npm install`

- You might need to rebuild the project using `gulp`.

- `node dist/index`

- Head your browser to `localhost`

- You're done.

If you want to tweak things up, the source code is meant to be very straightfoward.

If you want to run the server in `production` mode (with dead code elimination, with much less runtime checks, and minification), run:

- `NODE_ENV=production gulp`

- `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index`

Have fun!
